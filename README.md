# RVA-Hotspot
By The Slick Quattro

RVA Hotspot is an application to connect Richmond visitors to the locals favorite food spots. No more getting chain food suggestions, get your suggestions straight from local foodies. The user will be able to search restaurants by type or scroll through a list of local favorites. If the user would like a more personalized recommendation they can reach out to the RVA Hotspot creators for more information. If the user decides that a liquid dinner is more their speed, the Open Brewery API will be used to populate a brewery in RVA.
